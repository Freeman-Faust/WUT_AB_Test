# WUT_AB_Test
Test for Interview with an Employer

Attempted to set up an Address Book App as part of a skills test

I chose to do so in Ionic because I've been learning Ionic. 
Unfortunately I did not prepare well enough, and got stymied trying to pass and manipulate
props as they passed through.  After hours of searching and tryiing various solutions, I gave up.

The app as is will display some basic categories, and has a simple layout, but not much more.

Please see the React App at https://github.com/Freeman-Faust/WUT-AB-Test-2 for more info.
